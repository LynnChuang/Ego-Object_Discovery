Object_Discovery
================

Object Discovery Algorithm on Egocentric Images.

Usage:

	For a single object discovery execution: modify the parameters 
	in loadParameters.m and then run main.m.
	
	For a battery of tests: comment the first line in main.m, change
	the parameters in tests_battery.m and run it.
	
	If you want to use the Multiscale Combinatorial Grouping (MCG) 
	Objectness [4], it must be downloaded from the authors page and 
	configured adding its path in loadParameters.m.
   

Explanation and additional features:

	This function is inspired by the pipeline proposed by 
       	K. Grauman in [1] with the following modifications:
           - Added Ferrari's Objectness [2], BING Objectness [3],
               Multiscale Combinatorial Grouping (MCG) [4] and
               Selective Search [6].
           - Added iterative Scene-Object discovery by turns.
           - Added Scene Awareness to the set of features.
           - Added Scene Score to the set of easiness scores.
           - Added Dimensionality Reduction based on LSH.
           - Added Locality Sensitive Hashing, K-Means, LSK+K-Means and 
               Ward instead of Complete-Link clustering for the grouping 
               of the easiest instances.
           - Added clustering by levels (using a different set of 
               features at each of them.
           - Adaptable for huge datasets (e.g. SenseCam or Narrative 
               lifelogging data).
           - Added CNN features [5] extraction for object candidates 
               and scenes.
           - Added PCA dimensionality reduction on easy objects.
	   		- Added initial ObjVsNoObj RBF-SVM classifier for discarding
				the majority of No Objects.
